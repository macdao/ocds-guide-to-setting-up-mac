I was always thinking about writing this article, to share all the experiences I've learnt from other colleagues. Though there are already some really good books, from which I've learnt a lot also. But I still want to share my own experiences.

In projects, I normally work with 1 to 10 people, and pairing a lot by sharing the same laptop, with external display, and extra mouse, keyboard. I'm mostly working with Java, Ruby, Node.js, Web and etc, and using lots of software from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), like IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, WebStorm, etc.

I know my knowledge is so limited, so I want the opinions from you by sharing you this article. Now days, more efficient way and better tools are still keeping comming, I'll keep updating it, to collect the better ways and tools here, it's my greedy wish. For latest version please visit: <https://github.com/macdao/ocds-guide-to-setting-up-mac>. Issues or Pull Requests are welcomed. Looking forward to your feedback.

Several points of efficient Mac environment in my opinion:

- Automate

  Take a example, there are several steps to install an application manually:
  1. Open your browser,
  2. Search by the application name,
  3. Open the official site for the applicaiton,
  4. Find the download link,
  5. Downloading,
  6. Install it,
  7. Some post steps.

  But with automatic tools, you only required to do:
  1. Open terminal,
  2. Type in commands,
  3. Wait to be finished.

  Automate helps to reduce the steps and increase efficiency significantly.

- Consistence

  When I'm pairing, sometimes the shortcuts or commands are different between each other's laptop. I strongly recommend that, at least in the team, try to keep using the same shortcut and commands(I forget the practice name, there have to be one, please let me know if you get it).

- Just enough

  Enough is perfect. If the system itself provides the function, I won't install any other third party tools.

- Efficiency

  Everything is about efficiency.

*For third party applications only simple steps are provided, please go to offial site for detailed installation and instruction documents.*

*Some sections are marked with [OCD], that means it's my personal preference, take it or ignore it, it all depends on if you like it or not.*

*[OCD(obsessive-compulsive disorder)](https://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CBsQFjAAahUKEwiDve-b7JHJAhUDxxQKHXF2DOE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FObsessive%25E2%2580%2593compulsive_disorder&usg=AFQjCNGDkJsHHtm6hy60uzEMBn2ee3rSoA&bvm=bv.107467506,d.d24), I didn't mean it, just make fun. Yes, I don't have that disease ;)*



## 1. macOS

Things related with macOS settings.

### Function Keys

By default, F1-F12 are special function keys, like adjust screen brightness. You are required to press Fn at the same time, when you need input F1-F12(like IntelliJ IDEA shortcuts). It's not so convenient for developers.

To avoid pressing Fn: go to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`，select `Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys` in `Keyboard` tab。

### Keyboard Only Control

You may see this dialog before, when you try to close files in Sublime Text:

![dialog-box-without-all-controls](dialog-box-without-all-controls.png)

You may notice that the `Save` button is quite different with the other two, it's BLUE. This kind of blue button is called `default button`, except triggering by clicking, you also can trigger it by `enter`.

What else, how to trigger `Don't Save` without mouse clicking?

Go to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`, select `All controls` in `Shortcuts` tab or just press `⌃F7`. And the dialog will turn into:

![dialog-box-with-all-controls](dialog-box-with-all-controls.png)

The `Don't Save` button has borders now, so you can trigger it by `space`. And also, you can move the focus(blue borders) to other buttons by press `tab`, you can get rid of your mouse now.

Except the way above, you can also select `Don't Save` by click `⌘⌫`(command+delete). This shortcut means select any button which means 'delete' or 'do not save'.

Of course, you may click `Esc` to trigger `Cancel`.

*Some lines are missing here. As not helping a lot - fff*

### Others

Reduce using of Mouse and Trackpad may increase your efficiency.

- [Mac keyboard shortcts](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201236)

  Apple official documents. Like how to move cursor between lines, words and so on.

- [Mac keyboard shortcuts for accessibility features](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204434)

  Apple official documents. The selection of blue button part is from this.

### Change `click` of Trackpad to `Tap`

By default Trackpad is triggered by click, but you can change it to tap.

Goto `System Preferences` > `Trackpad`，check `Tap to click` in `Point & Click` tab.

### Voice

macOS can speak by：

```sh
say hello
```

Combine it with other bash commands using `&&` or `;` like this:

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup ; say mission complete
```

Also you can let it speak almost anywhere by selecting one word and press `⌥+Esc`(Alt/Option+Esc). Before that you need goto `System Preferences` > `Dictation & Speech`, check `Speak selected text when the key is pressed` in `Text to Speech` tab.

*Some lines are missing here. As not helping a lot - fff*

### Dock Position

Dock comes at the bottom of screen as default, but as the resolution is 16:10, we'd better move it to left or right of screen to gain more vertical space.

### Change `Caps Lock` to `Control`

I use `Control` a lot, but it's at the left buttom corner, which is quite hard to reach. And I prefer `Shift` to input capitals, or input lower case and transform them with shortcut, so I use `Caps Lock` quite few.

So, I change `Caps Lock` into `Control`. And I found that lots twers are doing the same thing, may be influenced by [HHKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard).

Howto: goto `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`, click `Modifier Keys...` in `Keyboard` tab, in the popup window change the option `Caps Lock (⇪) Key:` to `⌃ Control`.

### Remove all Dock icons[OCD]

*本条目对于强迫症适用。It's for OCD(obsessive-compulsive disorder)*

There are several icons on the Dock by default, I rarely use most of them. And after opening several daily applications, the Dock comes so noisy, and the icons turn to really small. So I remove all the static icons on the Dock, to make space for runing applications.

*Finder cannot be removed.*

This command can easily hide all static Dock icons instead of removing them one by one:

```sh
defaults write com.apple.dock static-only -boolean true; killall Dock
```

It's easy to recovery:

```sh
defaults delete com.apple.dock static-only; killall Dock
```

*The `Downloads`Folder on the Dock will be hidden too*


### Reset the order of icons on Launchpad[OCD]

*本条目对于强迫症适用。It's for OCD(obsessive-compulsive disorder)*

```sh
defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock
```

### Keychain Access

Keychain Access is a macOS application. It can be used to find saved accounts and passwords including Wi-Fi password.

*Some lines are missing here. As not helping a lot - fff*

### Efficient Cursor

By default, cursor has pretty slow blinking and moving speed. When you need delete a large paragraphs of text by pressing the backspace, you are probably wasting your time. Even you hold the backspace key hardly, the cursor is still as slow as a snail.

Speed up cursor: Go to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`, move `Key Repeat` and `Delay Until Repeat` slidebars to rightmost under `Keyboard` tab. Enjoy your speed now!

## 2. Daily Tools

Some routine software, and not necessarily related to development.

### [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

Package management, official description: "The missing package manager for macOS".

Go to official site for installation steps.

After installation, you only need to run command below to install mysql, gradle, maven, node：

```sh
brew install mysql gradle maven node
```

PS: install brew will download and install Apple Command Line Tools automatically.

*Some lines are missing here. As not helping a lot - fff*

### [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/)

brew-cask helps you to install macOS Applications. Like to install Chrome：`brew cask install google-chrome`. Also Evernote, Skype, Sublime Text, VirtualBox, Java7 ...

brew-cask is driven by community, you may raise a pull request when you found any missing or outdated application.

You can find the installation method on offical website.

You would like to search if you not sure if some application is already in cask.

```sh
brew search java
```

*Some lines are missing here. As not helping a lot - fff*

### [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)

iTerm2 is the most widely used terminal tool, considered as the replacement of Terminal. It provides [a group of practical features](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html), including `Split Panes`. Its default black background makes me throw away macOS' inbuilt Terminal application without any hesitation.

Installation:

```sh
brew cask install iterm2
```

Thanks to brew-cask ~

In iTerm2, except the commond shortcuts like `^E`(ctrl+E)(find more [here](#Others)). And after some configuration you can have more shortcuts like `⌥B`(alt+B), `⌥F`(alt+F).
HowTo: go to `Preferences` > `Profiles` > `Keys`, change the option of `Left option (⌥) key acts as` and `Right option (⌥) key acts as` to `+ESC`.

When you open new window/tab, by default you're at user home directory, and need input commands to go somewhere else. If you want to open new window/tab in previous directory, you can set it like this:
`Preferences` > `Profiles`, and select your profile('Default' for most of time), go to `General` tab, check `Reuse previous seesion's directory` for `Working Directory`.

If you want to save all the current windows/tabs layout, press `⌘⇧S`(command+shift+S) to save the window arrangement. Also you can find this item in the `Window` menu on the top.(*added by fff*)

Till now, Terminal should be given up, and turn to use iTerm2.

And in iTerm2, double click will select the according word, triple click will select the current line. Also the selected content will be in your clip-board, no addition `⌘C`(command+C) is required.

### [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh)

By default Bash is only white and black, there is no more colors there. And On-My-Zsh brings the colorful world to you. Oh-My-Zsh also brings you a set of plugins and tools, which is quite handy for simplify commands input. In the below you will find that I love it to death.

Go to official site for installation steps.

Plugins I'm using: `git z sublime history rbenv bundler rake`

Oh-My-Zsh uses Z shell（zsh）, which is quite close to Bash, but it's not Bash.

In Z shell, `~/.zshrc` is the most important configure file. Oh-My-Zsh will set the current path into `~/.zshrc` as `$PATH` during installation. As I'm using brew, this is not something that I want to have. With brew, we are not encouraged to customize `$PAHT`, and by default Oh-My-Zsh already set `$PAHT` with quite good value:`$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH`, in which contains the `$HOME/bin`, it means we can put customized scripts in `$HOME/bin`.

so I recommend you to reset the `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
```

> [Since a commit on Jun 17 2016](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/commit/551abfcbb48a0c001eadef80abc3276af4e9ad26), the `zshrc.zsh-template` didn't change `$PATH` any more. Find `# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH` and remove the `#` to make our life better。

Oh-My-Zsh gets [more valuable plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins-Overview).

Besides Oh-My-Zsh, there is [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)，which based on [Fishshell](http://fishshell.com/).

### Git Alias

Almost everyone is looking for ways to increase their efficiency, like git alias, using `git st` instead of `git status`. But it requires some manual configuration, which makes everyone's configuration differ.

Oh-My-Zsh provides a set of system aliases to achieve the same purpose. For example: take `gst` as the alias of `git status`. Also the git plugin of Oh-My-Zsh is enabled by default, which means if you're using Oh-My-Zsh, you are having a set of efficient aliases, which is been commonly used globally, isn't that wonderful?!

Some of my frequently used aliases are:

Alias | Command
----- | -------
gapa  | `git add --patch`
gc!   | `git commit -v --amend`
gcl   | `git clone --recursive`
gclean| `git reset --hard && git clean -dfx`
gcm   | `git checkout master`
gcmsg | `git commit -m`
gco   | `git checkout`
gd    | `git diff`
gdca  | `git diff --cached`
glola | `git log --graph --pretty = format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --all`
gp    | `git push`
grbc  | `git rebase --continue`
gst   | `git status`
gup   | `git pull --rebase`
gwip  | `git add -A; git rm $(git ls-files --deleted) 2> /dev/null; git commit -m "--wip--"`

The full list is here: <https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugin:git>, or simply run command `alias | grep git` in Oh-My-Zsh window.

### ShiftIt

In macOS you only can adjust window size by dragging. I've tried lots of window management tools, but most of them have the conflict key mapping(mostly with IntelliJ IDEA). ShiftIt is the apparently rare one without any conflicts.

Installation:

```sh
brew cask install shiftit
```

SizeUp is one replacer，share the same main shortcuts with ShiftIt.

Divvy is another replacer, need to purchase through appstore.(*added by fff*)

For hackers: [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate), configuration reference: <http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/>

### Sublime Text 2

Installation:

```sh
brew cask install sublime-text
```

Open file with Sublime Text in command line is quite handy, normally we need to link it first(following:[OS X Command Line](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html)) with: `ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl`.

But if you install it with brew-cask, the problem is already sorted by brew-cask, and it will remove the link when you uninstall Sublime Text.

At the same time, Oh-My-Zsh also provides the plugin for Sublime Text: `sublime`(<https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/sublime>), which is perfectly compliant with brew installed Sublime Text.

Replacers: Atom, TextMate, Sublime Text 3 etc. For all of them, brew-cask will manage the links for you.

### [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

MacDown is a Markdown editor. As Mou doesn't support code highlighting, I switched to MacDown, which supports [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) perfectly.

I like Markdown a lot, and I write articles(include this one) with Markdown, also for slides([reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)). Markdown makes me focus on the content itself, and won't waste me too much time on the styles and layouts.

Installation:

```sh
brew cask install macdown
```

### [z](https://github.com/rupa/z)

After opening new terminal, how do you get to the working directory? `cd xxx` or `^R`(ctrl+R, bash reverse search), or alias?

z helps you get the target directory easily. Like running `z cask` in my terminal, it will lead me to `/usr/local/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew-cask/Casks`.

It's quite easy to install, nothing is required to be downloaded, as it's already in Oh-My-Zsh. Open `~/.zshrc`, find plugins configuration line like this:`plugins=(git)`, and put `z` inside the parentheses like:`plugins=(git z)`, then re-initial terminal by `source ~/.zshrc`, it's there now.

Autojump is a replacer, which requires to be installed by brew.

### [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)

Vimium is a Google Chrome extension, which turns your chrome into a "hackers's browser", you can operate your Chrome via keyboard.

For installation please go to Chrome Extension Market.

For firefox there is a similar solution: [KeySnail](https://github.com/mooz/keysnail).

### [Surfingkeys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys)

Surfingkeys is another Chrome/Firefox extension that provides keyboard-based navigation and control of the web in the spirit of the VIM editor. But it's not for VIM users only, it's for anyone who just needs some more shortcuts to his own functions.

### [LastPass](https://lastpass.com)

LastPass is a password management tool, support a second login step, provides plugins for every browser and also macOS desktop version.

The most important thing, it provides **command line** version, install it by:

```sh
brew install lastpass-cli --with-pinentry
```

then, login into your account:

```sh
lpass login you@email.com
```

So you can copy password or integrate into other commands:

```sh
lpass show --password gmail.com -c
```

### [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

SourceTree is an outstanding git GUI client by Atlassian. You may try if you want more than command line.

Installation:

```sh
brew cask install sourcetree
```

Brew-cast will add `stree` to `$PATH` when installing it. Run `stree` from terminal will invoke SourceTree open the Git repository under current path. for more: `stree --help`.

### [CheatSheet](http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/)

CheatSheet will show a list of all active short cuts of the current application. Just hold the `⌘` for a bit longer.

![CheatSheet](http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/imgs/main.png)

Installation:

```sh
brew cask install cheatsheet
```

### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)

The must have tool for Mac user, comes together with a bunch of workflows, which will extremely save your operating time.

Easy to start, but takes more time to setup your self-defined workflows, but anyway there are already lots of workflows shared by nice people, visit [here](http://www.alfredworkflow.com/), choose what you like, and modify it in your way.

Installation:

```sh
brew cask install alfred
```

### [Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

GNU stow is the super girl(-.-) of symlink management. Mainly it's used to symlink your [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/), like Emacs，Git configuration files of fish shell/Zsh.

Installation:

```
brew install stow
```

After installing, we can symlink the dotfiles. The full instructions for stow and dotfiles are here:<https://github.com/jcouyang/dotfiles>.

After symlinking all your dotfiles to `~/dotfiles`, push it to github. There is no worries any more for setuping another new laptop.

## 3. Tools for developers

### Java

There is no default JDK any more for new version of macOS, so you need to download and install it before you want to do some Java projects.

Before brew-cask, we are used to download from: <https://developer.apple.com/downloads/>. But the drawback is that uninstall or upgrades take significant time.

For JDK package, which is pkg format, there is no automatic way to uninstall it.

But good news is brew-cask can do it for you:

```sh
brew cask install java
```

If you need Java-11 or Java-6, you can get from [homebrew-cask-versions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions)：

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew cask install java11
```

You can install several versions of JDK in macOS, `/usr/libexec/java_home -V` will list all of them.

So here is the problem, Which one is the one used by running `java` or any Java application? normally, macOS invokes the newest version of all those installed JDK versions. But you can change it by set `JAVA_HOME`:

```sh
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)
$ JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home java -version
java version "1.6.0_65"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-466.1-11M4716)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-466.1, mixed mode)
```

You may change `JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home` into `` JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6` ``, which is more widely used.


Need to install JDK 8/9? Due to [Java8 not working anymore](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions/issues/7253), brew-cask does not privde those Oracle JDK any more. You can try [AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk) or download pkg from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com).

*Some lines are missing here. As not helping a lot - fff*

### [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)

Everyone needs a Ruby version management tool. That's rbenv, which is quite light and can be installed by brew.

Installation:

```sh
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Then you need to enable `rbenv` plugin of Oh-My-Zsh, or you need to add `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`

Sometimes projects will depend on unique Ruby versions, like: `ruby-2.1.0`, you should go checkout [rbenv-aliases](https://github.com/tpope/rbenv-aliases).

```sh
brew install rbenv-aliases
```

Alternatives: RVM, chruby. But as RVM is unable to be installed by brew, and it also changes a bunch of files without any respect, that's why I already gave RVM up. chruby is another light weight tool, and works perfactly with Oh-My-Zsh, it seems someone is using it in production enviroment.

### Ruby Daily Alias

Almost every Rubyist takes `bi` as alias of `bundle install`. Oh-My-Zsh provides `builder` plugin to setup a set of alias, like `bi`, `be`. Also allow you to run `rspec` directly, without any leading `be` or `bundle exec`.

For a detailed list please go to <https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/bundler>.

Zsh shell has special usage for `[` and `]`, so `rake task[parameter]` will fail, you need to run it like this: `rake task\[parameter\]` or `noglob rake task[parameter]`. However Oh-My-Zsh already solves it, using the buildin rake plugin: `brake task[parameter]`.

Be aware of that, put `rake` after `bundler` when modifying the plugin settings in `~/.zshrc`, for example:
```
plugins=(git z sublime history rbenv bundler rake)
```

### Node Version Manager

There are many node version management tools. In here, I recommend nodenv, which is quite light and can be installed by brew.

* [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)

  This tool is the same as rbenv, you can install it like this:

  ```
  brew install nodenv
  ```

  Then you need to add the following code into `~/zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`.

  ```sh
  export PATH="$HOME/.nodenv/bin:$PATH"
  eval "$(nodenv init -)"
  ```

Other tools:

* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

  This tool is the same as RVM, you can reference official doc to install it.

* [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

  Another simple tool, please reference official doc.

* [NVS](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs)

  A cross-platform tool for switching between versions and forks of Node.js.
